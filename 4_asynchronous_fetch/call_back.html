<h1>Callback function in JS:</h1>
<h3>What is callback?</h3>
<p>A callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument, which is then invoked inside the outer function to complete some kind of routine or action.</p>
<script>
    // Example 1
    // This example explains enough what the callback is and how to use it. The example is collected from MDN.

    function greeting(name) {
        alert('Hello ' + name);
    }

    function processUserInput(callback) {
        var name = prompt('Please enter your name.');
        callback(name);
    }

    processUserInput(greeting);
    /*
    - The function greeting is passed as an argument of processUserInput().
    - So the 'callback' is referring to the function greeting().
    - This way is helpful to execute some action synchronously in JS as the JS it self a asynchronous.
    */

    // Example 2
    function doHomework(first, second) {
        alert(`Starting my ${first} homework.`);
        second();
    }

    doHomework('math', function() {
        alert('Finished my homework');
    });
    /*
    - In definition the function doHomework() is passing 2 arguments. The first argument is being used as a variable which is
    the name of the subject. The second argument is used as a function.
    - In invocation the first argument is the name of the subject and the
    second argument is a function as a function is required in the definition of this function.

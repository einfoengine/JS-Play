            <h1>JS Play</h1>
            Welcome to JavaScript Play tutorial.
            Hi, this tutorial is mainly created to help those who are interested in to core JS development and learning the basics of this language. This will include some kiddish projects to some quite professional level of projects. I will add the small projects in a same .html file and a bit bigger size are in a different .html file. Hope I can contribute to them who are keen to learn at any age and any thing. Best of luck.
